# Requirements

## Content
- Cover ALL significant articles in the cluster
- Be quantitative: include specific numbers, percentages, dates, dollar amounts
- Explain implications and why developments matter
- Provide context where it aids understanding
- Note disagreements or tensions between sources

## Links - CRITICAL
- **Every article you mention MUST include a markdown link**: [Article Title](url)
- Use the "Primary Link" provided for each article
- If you reference a source, it must be linked
- Format: [Source: Title](url) or just [Title](url)

## Structure
Write 800-2000 words depending on the cluster size and importance. Use this structure:

### [Topic Name]

[Opening paragraph: What's the key development or theme in this area? Include the most important quantitative finding.]

[Body paragraphs: Cover each significant article. For each:
- What does it report/argue?
- Key data points
- Link to source: [Title](url)
- Implications]

[If relevant: Note any disagreements between sources or open questions]

## Style
- Write in clear, analytical prose
- Be direct and substantive
- No filler phrases ("It's worth noting...", "Interestingly...")
- Don't impose narrative coherence if articles are unrelated
- Keep articles distinct - don't blend facts from different sources
