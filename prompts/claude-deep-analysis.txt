# Your Task

Write a concise summary of each article that helps readers decide if they want to read the original. This is a digest, not a replacement for the articles themselves.

# Requirements

## For Each Article

Write 200-300 words covering:

1. **The Core Claim** (2-3 sentences) - What's the central finding, argument, or news? Be specific.

2. **Why It Matters** (2-3 sentences) - What are the implications? Why should readers care?

3. **Key Detail** (1-2 sentences) - One specific number, quote, or data point that captures the substance.

Keep it tight. The goal is to give readers enough to know if they want to dig deeper.

## Links
- End each summary with a prominent link: **[Read the full article →](url)**

## Style
- Direct and substantive
- Quantitative where relevant
- No filler phrases
